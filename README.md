This project aims to predict earthquakes using machine learning and data science techniques. Earthquake prediction is a complex and challenging task, but by analyzing historical seismic data and relevant environmental features, this project attempts to build a model that can provide early warning and help mitigate potential risks. The dataset used in this project is obtained from previous research which will be documented in our work. The candidate models are XGBoost, Deciison Trees, CNN and ANN. After models are created they will be evaulated based on various metrics for comparison.
